# Project Title: EEG Data Analysis and Classification Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques

## Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing and classifying EEG (Electroencephalography) data using a combination of classical machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to preprocess EEG data, extract meaningful features, and build models that can classify the signals accurately. The project includes a detailed process of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the implementation of machine learning models.

## Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns (e.g., SubjectID, VideoID, predefinedlabel), and transforming features for better model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Creating visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships, such as box plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.
Feature Engineering: Extracting and transforming key features, particularly focusing on the user-definedlabeln column for analysis.
Modeling Techniques: Implementing classical machine learning models as well as deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras.
Evaluation: Using confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves to evaluate model performance.

## Dataset:
Source: The dataset used for this analysis consists of EEG signals and relevant features that describe various aspects of the recorded signals.
Columns: Important columns include features from EEG signals and the user-definedlabeln column, which acts as the target variable for classification.

## Libraries Used:
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Scikit-Learn: For machine learning modeling and evaluation.
TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training deep learning models.

## Steps:
Data Import & Cleaning: Importing necessary libraries and dataset, handling missing data, and removing irrelevant columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and relationships using box plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.
Data Preprocessing: Encoding and transforming columns, especially converting the user-definedlabeln column to integers for classification.
Modeling: Implementing various classical machine learning models, as well as deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating models using confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves.

## How to Run:
Install the required libraries (e.g., using pip install -r requirements.txt).
Run the notebook (.ipynb) to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate the results.

## Results:
Visualizations of data distributions and relationships.
Performance metrics of machine learning and deep learning models in classifying EEG data.

## Future Work:
Further fine-tuning of the deep learning models.
Exploring additional EEG datasets to improve the generalizability of the models.
